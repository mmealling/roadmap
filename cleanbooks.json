Many\ngenerations have passed since that terrible time, and the remnants of\ncivilization have re-formed into separate, vastly different societies. The\ndominant culture of a widely diminished Earth, the ecologically sensitive\nMaurai hold fast to their belief that “non-green” science is an\nunacceptable evil. But the reborn dream of space flight harbored by a\nforward-thinking few could herald the revival of the nuclear technology\nthat once ravaged the planet and its people—and the powerful Maurai\nFederation will take every step necessary, no matter how drastic, to\nprevent doomsday from dawning again. An enthralling work of speculative\nfiction from a winner of the Nebula and Hugo Awards, Orion Shall Rise is a\nfeat of world-building and a sobering view of tomorrow by one of the\ntwentieth century’s most revered science fiction masters. Poul Anderson’s\nmonumental tale combines science, anthropology, philosophy, and global\npolitics with breathtaking action and adventure, offering an ingeniously\nunique and provocative vision of humankind’s all-too-possible destiny. This\nebook includes the bonus story “The Sky People.”",

La tripulación de la nave en\nque viajaba se ve obligada a evacuar el planeta a causa de una tormenta de\npolvo, dejando atrás a Mark tras darlo por muerto. Pero él está vivo, y\natrapado a millones de kilómetros de cualquier ser humano, sin posibilidad\nde enviar señales a la Tierra.

Sin embargo, Mark\nno se da por vencido; armado con su ingenio, sus habilidades y sus\nconocimientos sobre botánica, se enfrentará a obstáculos aparentemente\ninsuperables. Por suerte, el sentido del humor resultará ser su mayor\nfuente de fuerza. Obstinado en seguir con vida, incubará un plan\nabsolutamente demencial para ponerse en contacto con la NASA.

Only a simple training\nmission to test a new survey instrument intended for the first manned\nAmerican-Russian interstellar flight. What he got was just a bit different.\nFirst, there was the fact that Earth didn't actually have a Moon. Then\nthere was the three thousand-kilometer diameter alien starship pretending\nit was the Moon. And the millennia-old cybernetic intelligence that\nshanghaied him to serve as its crew. Colin might have been forgiven for\nthinking that those were enough surprises for any one man, but there were a\nfew other small problems. Like the deadly mutiny which had been raging\nlonger than the human race had existed on Earth ... and still wasn't over.\nOr like the millions of other starships, crewed by genocidal aliens\ndedicated to the extermination of all possible competing life forms, which\njust happened to be headed straight towards Earth. Or like the interstellar\nempire whose aid offered humanity's only hope for survival... except for\nthe minor fact that its last emperor and all of his subjects had died\nforty-five thousand years ago. Add in the occasional homicidal terrorist,\nreligious fanatics convinced that the only good Maclntyre was a dead\nMaclntyre, a bic-weapon capable of killing every living thing on any\nplanet, a super-bomb which could take out whole worlds, a starship drive\nwhich could destroy complete solar systems, and the need to organize the\nentire planet Earth¾ and all of its warring, mutually murderous\nfactions¾for a probably hopeless last-ditch defense, and Colin was\nconvinced that things were just about as bad as they could possibly get.\nUntil he found out whose job it had just become to fix all those problems,\nof course....

Cover\nfeatures Rocket City Rednecks cast with a backyard-made rocket. Popular\nscience from the Rocket City Rednecks, as seen in multiple appearances on\nthe Tonight Show with Jay Leno and in the National Geographic Channel’s hit\nseries. Meet the Rocket City Rednecks. They’re five “backwoods” guys from\nthe rocket city: Huntsville, Alabama, home to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight\nCenter and the birthplace of the U.S. space program. Sure, they love to\nshoot stuff and drink beer, and one of ’em lives in a trailer, but with a\nfamily tree full of NASA rocket scientists (not to mention their own PhDs\nand advanced degrees), they aim a little higher—like using homemade\nmoonshine to fuel a rocket! Now, in typical laidback style, Dr. Travis S.\nTaylor, leader of the crew, delivers the goods on how America can return to\nspace exploration and manned space flight – and can probably do so with\ncommon items found in a typical redneck backyard. What’s needed is a good\nold “try anything” attitude, a bit of gumption, and the spectacularly\nentertaining backyard science that’s the Rocket City Redneck specialty.",

Ashlee Vance captures the full\nspectacle and arc of the genius’s life and work, from his tumultuous\nupbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic\ntechnical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk’s story\nto explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of\ninventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete\nin an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk—one of the most\nunusual and striking figures in American business history—is a\ncontemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists\nincluding Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More\nthan any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his\nown vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as\nthe visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy. Thorough and\ninsightful, Elon Musk brings to life a technology industry that is rapidly\nand dramatically changing by examining the life of one of its most powerful\nand influential titans.",

Opening with a\nshort account of Nikolai Kibalchich, a late nineteenth-century Russian\nrocketry theoretician, McDougall argues that the Soviet Union made its way\ninto space first because it was the world's first \"technocracy\"—which he\ndefines as \"the institutionalization of technological change for state\npurpose.\" He also explores the growth of a political economy of technology\nin both the Soviet Union and the United States.",

            "desc": "This is the story of SpaceX. In the pre-dawn hours of 22 May 2012, a\nconventional looking rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral on what was only\nits third flight. Yet it was carrying a spacecraft to conduct history's\nfirst commercial mission to the International Space Station, and along with\nit, America's best chance to restore its space-faring capability. The total\ntaxpayer cost for developing the rocket and the spacecraft, including its\nprevious flights, was $396 million, a fraction of the amount NASA had spent\non any comparable project. For Elon Musk and SpaceX Exploration\nTechnologies Corp, a company founded only a decade earlier, it was a\nstunning accomplishment, yet it was only one stop on a journey which leads\nall the way to Mars. From its earliest trials and near disaster on the\nremote Pacific atoll of Kwajalein to four successful missions to the\nInternational Space Station, Here Be Dragons vividly details the first era\nof SpaceX. Set against a national space program in complete disarray at the\nend of the Shuttle era, it is also the story of a unique public/ private\npartnership with NASA, one that holds the promise of a new era of space\nexploration. For anyone who has ever looked to the small, ruddy planet in\nthe night sky and felt its inexorable pull, it may also be the story of\nsomething much greater, the opening act in one of the most significant\ndevelopments in human history, the founding of a second branch of human\ncivilisation... on Mars.",

Following the\nmost recent spate of layoffs, the labor strike grumblings have only grown\nlouder, so the company is sending former base administrator and recovering\nalcoholic Lester Riddell back into the fold in an attempt to boost morale\nand output alike. The truth, however, becomes shockingly apparent to\nRiddell almost immediately upon his return. Not only has he been\nunceremoniously dumped into a muddled mess of larceny, piracy, and\ncorporate malfeasance, it appears that Skycorp is purposely setting him up\nto fail—which could spell finis for Descartes Station and every trash-\ntalking, pot-smoking, porn-loving Vacuum Sucker and Moondog who toils\nthere. But as the Skycorp suits are about to discover, they’ve just made\nthe biggest mistake of their corporate lives—because Lester Riddell is\nnobody’s fall guy. Three-time Hugo Award winner Allen Steele has seen the\nnear future, and it isn’t pretty—it’s noisy, dirty, dangerous, and chaotic.\nThrilling, wildly inventive, delightfully profane, and totally outrageous,\nLunar Descent is one hell of rocket ride, with a master of science fiction\nat the helm.",

La Tierra y su centenar de colinas espaciales están\nsuperpobladas; llevan una vida anárquica y socialmente degenerada. A dos\naños luz de distancia, oculta en un rincón de la galaxia, brilla una\nestrella parecida al Sol de la Tierra, una estrella que posee su propio\nsistema planetario: Megas, Erythro y Rotor, una colonia renegada de la\nTierra. La estrella se llama Némesis y al ser descubierta es considerada\ncomo la última esperanza de la raza humana, un nuevo punto de partida para\nun valiente grupo de aventureros dirigidos por Januss Pitt, un individuo\nbrillante pero megalómano. Pitt y sus leales seguidores se han separado en\nsecreto de la órbita de la Tierra viajando por vía superluminal hasta el\nSistema Nemético para establecer allí una nueva Utopía, una sociedad más\nfuerte, más pura y, en definitiva, superior a la dejada atrás. Sin embargo,\nMarlene, una chica de quince años natural de Rotor, se ha enterado de la\nsutil aunque terrible amenaza que Némesis representa para la Tierra y sus\nhabitantes. En realidad, Pitt ha dedicado su vida a asegurarse de que esta\nnueva civilización se convierta en la potencia suprema de la galaxia, al\nprecio que sea. Y no permitirá que nadie se interponga en su camino.\nMarlene llega a descubrir que Némesis no solo amenaza a la Tierra, sino\ntambién a Rotor, e intenta salvar a ambos.

Or so it seems.\nVice President Charlie Haskell, who will travel anywhere for a photo op, is\nabout to cut the ribbon for the just-completed American Moonbase. The first\nMars voyage is about to leave high orbit, with a woman at the helm. Below,\nthe world is marveling at a rare solar eclipse. But all that is right is\nabout to go disastrously wrong when an amateur astronomer discovers a new\ncomet. Named for its discover, Tomikois a \"sun-grazer,\"an interstellar\nwanderer with a hundred times the mass and ten times the speed of other\ncomets. And it is headed straight for our moon. In less than five days, if\nscientists' predictions are right, Tomiko will crash into the moon,\nshattering it into a cloud of superheated gas, dust, and huge chunks of\nrock that will rain down on the earth, causing chaos and killer storms,\npossibly tidal waves inundating entire cities...or worse: a single\napocalyptic worldwide \"extinction event.\" In the meantime, the population\nof Moonbase must be evacuated by a hastily assembled fleet of shuttle\nrockets. There isn't room, or time enough, for everyone. And the vice\npresident, who rashly promised to be last off (\"I will lock the door and\nturn off the lights\"), is trying to figure out how to get away without\neating his words. In Moonfall,McDevitt has created a disaster thriller of\ntruly epic proportions, featuring a cast of unforgettable characters: the\nreluctant Russian rocket jockey entrusted with the lives of squabbling\nrefugees; the woman chosen to be first on the moon; the scientist who must\ndeflect the \"possum\" (POSSible IMpactors) knocked from orbit or witness the\nend science itself. And at the center of it all is Charlie Haskell, the\ncareer politician who discovers his own unexpected reserves of only himself\nand his country, but for all humankind. Moonfall,is a spellbinding tale of\nheroism and hope, cowardice and passion played against the awesome\nspectacle of human history's darkest night.",

Ordinary people are faced with\nextraordinary choices - some hesitate, some succumb to personal ambition,\nsome choose belief over science, and some simply give up. To those who\ncling to a vision of humans as more than an Earth-bound species, Mars\nprovides hope for all - a new home and a haven for humanity.

Are we capable of sacrificing individual ambition for the\ncontinuation of the race? Can we become a global community and accomplish\ngreatness in a time of great peril? And most importantly, can we become the\nchildren of Earth and Mars to save humanity?",

Not the Star Trek notion of tearing around the Galaxy in a huge\nspaceship-that was obviously beyond existing tech nology-but a more\nrealistic mission. In 1989 I had videotaped Voyager 2's encounter with\nNeptune and watched the drama of robotic exploration over and over again. I\nstarted to wonder whether we could do something similar with Alpha\nCentauri, the nearest star to the Sun. Everyone seemed to agree that manned\nflight to the stars was out of the question, if not permanently then for\nthe indefinitely foreseeable future. But surely we could do something with\nrobotics. And if we could figure out a theoretical way to do it, how far\nwere we from the actual technology that would make it happen? In other\nwords, what was the state of our interstellar technology today, those\nconcepts and systems that might translate into a Voyager to the stars?\nFinding answers meant talking to people inside and outside of NASA. I was\nsurprised to learn that there is a large literature of interstellar flight.\nNobody knows for sure how to propel a space craft fast enough to make the\ninterstellar crossing within a time scale that would fit the conventional\nidea of a mission, but there are candidate systems that are under active\ninvestigation. Some of this effort begins with small systems that we'll use\nnear the Earth and later hope to extend to deep space missions.",
