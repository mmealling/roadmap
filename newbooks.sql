attempt to revive the forbidden technology that destroyed their world.
Centuries ago, humankind was nearly destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse. Many
generations have passed since that terrible time, and the remnants of
civilization have re-formed into separate, vastly different societies. The
dominant culture of a widely diminished Earth, the ecologically sensitive
Maurai hold fast to their belief that “non-green” science is an
unacceptable evil. But the reborn dream of space flight harbored by a
forward-thinking few could herald the revival of the nuclear technology
that once ravaged the planet and its people—and the powerful Maurai
Federation will take every step necessary, no matter how drastic, to
prevent doomsday from dawning again. An enthralling work of speculative
fiction from a winner of the Nebula and Hugo Awards, Orion Shall Rise is a
feat of world-building and a sobering view of tomorrow by one of the
twentieth century’s most revered science fiction masters. Poul Anderson’s
monumental tale combines science, anthropology, philosophy, and global
politics with breathtaking action and adventure, offering an ingeniously
unique and provocative vision of humankind’s all-too-possible destiny. This

Lieutenant Commander Colin Maclntyre, USN, expected. Only a simple training
mission to test a new survey instrument intended for the first manned
American-Russian interstellar flight. What he got was just a bit different.
First, there was the fact that Earth didn''t actually have a Moon. Then
there was the three thousand-kilometer diameter alien starship pretending
it was the Moon. And the millennia-old cybernetic intelligence that
shanghaied him to serve as its crew. Colin might have been forgiven for
thinking that those were enough surprises for any one man, but there were a
few other small problems. Like the deadly mutiny which had been raging
longer than the human race had existed on Earth ... and still wasn''t over.
Or like the millions of other starships, crewed by genocidal aliens
dedicated to the extermination of all possible competing life forms, which
just happened to be headed straight towards Earth. Or like the interstellar
empire whose aid offered humanity''s only hope for survival... except for
the minor fact that its last emperor and all of his subjects had died
forty-five thousand years ago. Add in the occasional homicidal terrorist,
religious fanatics convinced that the only good Maclntyre was a dead
Maclntyre, a bic-weapon capable of killing every living thing on any
planet, a super-bomb which could take out whole worlds, a starship drive
which could destroy complete solar systems, and the need to organize the
entire planet Earth¾ and all of its warring, mutually murderous
factions¾for a probably hopeless last-ditch defense, and Colin was
convinced that things were just about as bad as they could possibly get.

entrepreneurs—a real-life Tony Stark—and a fascinating exploration of the
renewal of American invention and its new “makers.” Elon Musk spotlights
the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and
innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his Internet
companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full
spectacle and arc of the genius’s life and work, from his tumultuous
upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic
technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk’s story
to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of
inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete
in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk—one of the most
unusual and striking figures in American business history—is a
contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists
including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More
than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his
own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as
the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy. Thorough and

first commercial mission to the International Space Station, and along with
it, America''s best chance to restore its space-faring capability. The total
taxpayer cost for developing the rocket and the spacecraft, including its
previous flights, was $396 million, a fraction of the amount NASA had spent
on any comparable project. For Elon Musk and SpaceX Exploration
Technologies Corp, a company founded only a decade earlier, it was a

all the way to Mars. From its earliest trials and near disaster on the
remote Pacific atoll of Kwajalein to four successful missions to the
International Space Station, Here Be Dragons vividly details the first era

años luz de distancia, oculta en un rincón de la galaxia, brilla una
estrella parecida al Sol de la Tierra, una estrella que posee su propio
sistema planetario: Megas, Erythro y Rotor, una colonia renegada de la

como la última esperanza de la raza humana, un nuevo punto de partida para
un valiente grupo de aventureros dirigidos por Januss Pitt, un individuo
brillante pero megalómano. Pitt y sus leales seguidores se han separado en
secreto de la órbita de la Tierra viajando por vía superluminal hasta el
Sistema Nemético para establecer allí una nueva Utopía, una sociedad más
fuerte, más pura y, en definitiva, superior a la dejada atrás. Sin embargo,
Marlene, una chica de quince años natural de Rotor, se ha enterado de la

habitantes. En realidad, Pitt ha dedicado su vida a asegurarse de que esta
nueva civilización se convierta en la potencia suprema de la galaxia, al

Vice President Charlie Haskell, who will travel anywhere for a photo op, is
about to cut the ribbon for the just-completed American Moonbase. The first
Mars voyage is about to leave high orbit, with a woman at the helm. Below,
the world is marveling at a rare solar eclipse. But all that is right is
about to go disastrously wrong when an amateur astronomer discovers a new
comet. Named for its discover, Tomikois a "sun-grazer,"an interstellar
wanderer with a hundred times the mass and ten times the speed of other
comets. And it is headed straight for our moon. In less than five days, if
scientists'' predictions are right, Tomiko will crash into the moon,
shattering it into a cloud of superheated gas, dust, and huge chunks of
rock that will rain down on the earth, causing chaos and killer storms,
possibly tidal waves inundating entire cities...or worse: a single
apocalyptic worldwide "extinction event." In the meantime, the population
of Moonbase must be evacuated by a hastily assembled fleet of shuttle
rockets. There isn''t room, or time enough, for everyone. And the vice
president, who rashly promised to be last off ("I will lock the door and
turn off the lights"), is trying to figure out how to get away without
eating his words. In Moonfall,McDevitt has created a disaster thriller of
truly epic proportions, featuring a cast of unforgettable characters: the
reluctant Russian rocket jockey entrusted with the lives of squabbling
refugees; the woman chosen to be first on the moon; the scientist who must
deflect the "possum" (POSSible IMpactors) knocked from orbit or witness the
end science itself. And at the center of it all is Charlie Haskell, the
career politician who discovers his own unexpected reserves of only himself
and his country, but for all humankind. Moonfall,is a spellbinding tale of
heroism and hope, cowardice and passion played against the awesome
spectacle of human history''s darkest night.', '{"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7xXdz_jcQkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7xXdz_jcQkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}', '2009-01-01'::date, '["Jack McDevitt"]');

flight. Not the Star Trek notion of tearing around the Galaxy in a huge
spaceship-that was obviously beyond existing tech nology-but a more
realistic mission. In 1989 I had videotaped Voyager 2''s encounter with
Neptune and watched the drama of robotic exploration over and over again. I
started to wonder whether we could do something similar with Alpha
Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun. Everyone seemed to agree that manned
flight to the stars was out of the question, if not permanently then for
the indefinitely foreseeable future. But surely we could do something with
robotics. And if we could figure out a theoretical way to do it, how far
were we from the actual technology that would make it happen? In other
words, what was the state of our interstellar technology today, those
concepts and systems that might translate into a Voyager to the stars?
Finding answers meant talking to people inside and outside of NASA. I was
surprised to learn that there is a large literature of interstellar flight.
Nobody knows for sure how to propel a space craft fast enough to make the
interstellar crossing within a time scale that would fit the conventional
idea of a mission, but there are candidate systems that are under active
investigation. Some of this effort begins with small systems that we''ll use
near the Earth and later hope to extend to deep space missions.', '{"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vgKbcQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vgKbcQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}', '2011-01-01'::date, '["Paul Gilster"]');
